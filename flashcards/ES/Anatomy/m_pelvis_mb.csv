"What are the major bones of the male pelvis?","The major bones of the male pelvis are the ilium, ischium, pubis, sacrum, and coccyx.",""
"What forms the pelvic inlet?","The pelvic inlet is formed by the sacral promontory, arcuate line, pectineal line, and pubic symphysis.",""
"What forms the pelvic outlet?","The pelvic outlet is bounded by the coccyx, ischial tuberosities, sacrotuberous ligaments, and the pubic arch.",""
"What is the difference between the male and female pelvis?","The male pelvis is narrower, has a heart-shaped inlet, a more acute subpubic angle, and a longer sacrum compared to the female pelvis.",""
"What is the function of the sacrotuberous ligament?","The sacrotuberous ligament stabilizes the sacrum and forms part of the greater and lesser sciatic foramina.",""
"What is the function of the sacrospinous ligament?","The sacrospinous ligament prevents excessive rotation of the sacrum and forms the greater and lesser sciatic foramina.",""
"What structures pass through the greater sciatic foramen?","The greater sciatic foramen transmits the sciatic nerve, superior and inferior gluteal vessels, and the pudendal nerve.",""
"What structures pass through the lesser sciatic foramen?","The lesser sciatic foramen transmits the pudendal nerve, internal pudendal vessels, and the tendon of the obturator internus muscle.",""
"What is the main function of the pelvic diaphragm?","The pelvic diaphragm supports pelvic organs and maintains continence.",""
"What muscles form the pelvic diaphragm?","The pelvic diaphragm is formed by the levator ani and coccygeus muscles.",""
"What muscles make up the levator ani?","The levator ani consists of the pubococcygeus, puborectalis, and iliococcygeus muscles.",""
"What is the function of the puborectalis muscle?","The puborectalis muscle maintains the anorectal angle, aiding in fecal continence.",""
"What is the function of the coccygeus muscle?","The coccygeus muscle supports the pelvic viscera and flexes the coccyx.",""
"Which muscle forms the lateral wall of the pelvis?","The obturator internus muscle forms the lateral wall of the pelvis.",""
"Which muscle forms the posterior wall of the pelvis?","The piriformis muscle forms the posterior wall of the pelvis.",""
"Through which foramen does the piriformis muscle exit the pelvis?","The piriformis muscle exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen.",""
"What is the function of the piriformis muscle?","The piriformis muscle laterally rotates and abducts the hip joint.",""
"What is the function of the obturator internus muscle?","The obturator internus muscle laterally rotates the hip and stabilizes the femoral head in the acetabulum.",""
"Which nerve innervates the levator ani?","The levator ani is innervated by the nerve to levator ani (S3-S4) and branches of the pudendal nerve.",""
"Which nerve innervates the coccygeus muscle?","The coccygeus muscle is innervated by branches of S4 and S5.",""
"What is the function of the deep perineal pouch?","The deep perineal pouch contains muscles and structures that support the pelvic floor and urethral sphincters.",""
"What muscles are found in the deep perineal pouch?","The deep perineal pouch contains the external urethral sphincter and deep transverse perineal muscles.",""
"What muscles are found in the superficial perineal pouch?","The superficial perineal pouch contains the bulbospongiosus, ischiocavernosus, and superficial transverse perineal muscles.",""
"What is the function of the ischiocavernosus muscle?","The ischiocavernosus muscle helps maintain erection by compressing the venous outflow of the penis.",""
"What is the function of the bulbospongiosus muscle in males?","The bulbospongiosus muscle aids in ejaculation and expels urine from the urethra.",""
"What is the function of the external anal sphincter?","The external anal sphincter controls voluntary defecation and maintains continence.",""
"What is the function of the perineal body?","The perineal body acts as a central support structure for perineal and pelvic muscles.",""
"What are the attachments of the inguinal ligament?","The inguinal ligament extends from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the pubic tubercle.",""
"What is the function of the arcuate line of the pelvis?","The arcuate line marks the transition between the true and false pelvis.",""
"What is the function of the sacroiliac joint?","The sacroiliac joint transmits weight from the axial skeleton to the lower limbs and provides stability.",""
"What type of joint is the sacroiliac joint?","The sacroiliac joint is a synovial joint with limited mobility.",""
"What is the function of the pubic symphysis?","The pubic symphysis provides a strong but flexible connection between the two pubic bones.",""
"What type of joint is the pubic symphysis?","The pubic symphysis is a secondary cartilaginous joint (symphysis).",""
"What is the obturator membrane?","The obturator membrane covers most of the obturator foramen, leaving the obturator canal for neurovascular structures.",""
"What structures pass through the obturator canal?","The obturator nerve, artery, and vein pass through the obturator canal.",""
"What is the function of the iliolumbar ligament?","The iliolumbar ligament stabilizes the lumbosacral junction by connecting the L5 vertebra to the ilium.",""
"What is the function of the sacrococcygeal ligament?","The sacrococcygeal ligament stabilizes the sacrococcygeal joint, which allows slight movement of the coccyx.",""
"What is the function of the anococcygeal ligament?","The anococcygeal ligament supports the anal canal and attaches the levator ani to the coccyx.",""
"What is the function of the perineal membrane?","The perineal membrane provides support to the urogenital structures and serves as an attachment point for perineal muscles.",""
