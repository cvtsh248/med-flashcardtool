"Taenia Solium/Saginata (cestode) transmission and pathogenesis","Gravid segments escape through anus and produce eggs in the perianal region.\nEggs hatch in pigs/cattle releasing oncosphere that reaches striated muscle. When humans eat poorly cooked meat, oncospheres excyst and develop into adult cestodes in small intestine.\nIf eggs are released in upper intestine, infection may occur in muscle, brain and other sites.","Diseases;Helminths;Infections;Microbiology"

"Schistosoma life cycle","1. Eggs passed in urine (s. haematobium) or faeces (s. japonicum or s. mansoni) and hatch in aggregations of water\n2. From eggs, mircecidae hatch into water, where they penetrate snails.\n3. Two generations of sporocytes are formed in the snail, where the second generation has fork tailed cecariae\n4. Using their fork tailed cecariae, the sporocytes penetrate the skin of the new host.\n5. In the host, the sporocytes shed their tails and become schistosomulae\n6. Schistosomulae migrate to the portal venous system.\n6. S. haematobium usually migrates to the bladder subsequently. Other species migrate to the rectum.\n8. Eggs are laid.\nEggs laid in the liver cause fibrosis and cirrhosis","Diseases;Helminths;Infections;Microbiology"
