What are the types of receptors,Type 1: Channel-linked receptors\nType 2:GPCR\nType 3:Kinase-linked receptors\nType 4: Intracellular receptors that control gene transcription,Cell Biology;Pharmacokinetics;Pharmacodynamics
What constitutes an agonist,An agonist has receptor affinity and intrinsic activity.\nDrug achieves Emax when all receptors are occupied,Pharmacodynamics
EC50,The dose of a drug at 50% Emax,Pharmacodynamics
Potency,The amount of drug required to produce an effect of a given magnitude\nI.e. Smaller EC50 -> Greater potency\nHigher affinity -> higher potency,Pharmacodynamics
Efficacy,The magnitude of response when a drug binds a receptor,Pharmacodynamics
Full agonist,Emax achieved when all receptors are occupied,Pharmacodynamics
Partial agonist,"Has receptor affinity, but less intrinsic activity (>0) than a full agonist (unity)\nCan compete with agonists and competitive agonists for binding",Pharmacodynamics
Inverse agonist,"Has receptor affinity, but NEGATIVE intrinsic activity\nCan compete with partial agonists and competitive antagonists",Pharmacodynamics
What constitutes and Antagonist?,Has receptor affinity but no efficacy and intrinsic activity,Pharmacodynamics
Competitive antagonist,"Same binding site as agonist\nDose response curve shifts RIGHT\nEmax stays the same, EC50 increases",Pharmacodynamics
Noncompetitive antagonist,"Binds at a different site compared to an agonist or irreversibly tightly to the main binding site\nInsurmountable\nDose response curve shifts UP\nEmax reduces, EC50 stays the same",Pharmacodynamics 
Non receptor-mediated antagonism is typically non competitive.,Correct,Pharmacodynamics
Types of non receptor-mediated antagonism,"Physiological antagonism: 2 independent receptor systems that oppose\nChemical antagonism: chemical combination between agonist and antagonist\nPharmacokinetic antagonism: alters concentration of agonist by affecting absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion\nReceptor blockade: Blocking ion channel through a drug",Pharmacodynamics
