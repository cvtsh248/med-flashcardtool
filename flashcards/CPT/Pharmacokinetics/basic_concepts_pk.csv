What is the role of phase II metabolic reactions?,Addition of groups that make the molecule more polar aiding in excretion,Pharmacokinetics;Metabolism
Cytochrome p450 is involved primarily in what phase of metabolism?,Phase I,Pharmacokinetics;Metabolism
An equation that summarises cytochrome p450's oxidative actions in phase I metabolism\nRH + NADPH + O2 + H+ -> ROH + NADP+ + H2O,Pharmacokinetics;Metabolism
Describe the mechanism a which cytochrome p450 oxidises things,1. Drug binds Fe3+ ligand at CYP active site\n2. NADP reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+\n3. O2 binds CYP\n4. O2 oxidises Fe2+ to Fe3+ and O2 recieves the electron\n5. NADPH reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+\n6. O2 oxidises Fe2+ to Fe3+\n7. Drug RH is hydroxylated to ROH\n8.ROH is released,Pharmacokinetics;Metabolism
Why does a defect in flavin containing monoxygenase cause one to stink of fish?\Flavin containing monoxygenase is responsible for the conversion of trimethylamine (smelly) to trimathylamin oxide (not smelly). Trimethylamine gets stored in fatty tissue and is a product of the metabolism of choline, and is a part of our diet.,Diseases;Pharmacokinetics;Metabolism
