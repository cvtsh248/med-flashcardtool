A build of of tyramine can cause what?,Hypertensive crisis\nTyramine competes with catecholamines for uptake 1 and displaces intracellular noradrenaline from intracellular storage vesicles into cytosol\nCytosolic noradrenaline can leak through membrane and trigger post synaptic adrenoreceptor.,Drugs;Autonomic Nervous System;Diseases
Why must one be cautious when prescribing beta blockers to COPD patients?,Beta 2 antagonism can cause bronchoconstriction,Drugs;Autonomic Nervous System Drugs;Beta Blockers
Can beta blockers be used in the setting of acute or unstable heart failure?,No because of their -ve ionotropic effect. However they can be used for chronic heart failure treatment and are associated with reduced mortality,Drugs;Autonomic Nervous System Drugs;Beta Blockers
